this file documents some of R/db.R -- the DB interface code.


table: sysreq_override
fields: depend_alias TEXT, r_pattern TEXT

SystemRequirements LIKE r_pattern are mapped onto the dependency alias
depend_alias (this is a foreign key in debian_dependency).

table: debian_dependency
fields: id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        alias TEXT,
        build INTEGER NOT NULL,
        debian_pkg TEXT NOT NULL,
        UNIQUE (alias,build,debian_pkg)

sets up a dependency alias. each row is a Debian dependency entry, debian_pkg, which
may be added to Depends: (and Build-Depends: if build = 1).

table: forced_depends
fields: r_name TEXT.
        depend_alias TEXT,
        PRIMARY KEY (r_name,depend_alias)'

forces the R package r_name to have the dependencies implied by depend_alias (a foriegn
key in debian_dependency).

table: license_override
fields: name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        accept INT NOT NULL

specifies whether the license, name, is accepted or rejected.

table: license_hashes
fields: name TEXT
        sha1 TEXT PRIMARY KEY

matches an SHA1 hash of the LICEN[CS]E file or part of the License: field to
a particular license name (a foreign key in license_override).

table: database_versions
fields: version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        version_date INTEGER,
        base_epoch INTEGER

a version of the database. each time one of the above tables (but not the below
tables) is updated, a new record is added to this table, indicating significant
changes to the database. version_date indicates when this change occurred
(seconds since UNIX epoch) and base_epoch is the Debian version epoch.

in future, all of the above fields should be versioned and somehow linked to
the packages that used them, so we only rebuild what is necessary.

table: packages
fields: package TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        latest_r_version TEXT

a package, and its latest R version. this is a copy of the 'available'
structure in the cran2deb R cache, and it is here as it allows queries on the
'builds' table to be much simpler (and perhaps faster).

table: builds
fields: id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        package TEXT,
        r_version TEXT,
        deb_epoch INTEGER,
        deb_revision INTEGER,
        db_version INTEGER,
        date_stamp TEXT,
        git_revision TEXT,
        success INTEGER,
        log TEXT,
        UNIQUE(package,r_version,deb_epoch,deb_revision,db_version)

Each time a 'package' is built, its 'success' is logged, along with the
particular database, cran2deb, R and Debian version information (db_version,
git_revision, r_version, deb_epoch, deb_revision) and the current date
(date_stamp). 'log' contains the output of the build process.

A new 'deb_revision' is assigned to each successful build.
