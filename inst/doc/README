To install:

$ cd ..
$ R CMD INSTALL cran2deb

copy cran2deb/exec/cran2deb into somewhere in your executable path (e.g.,
/usr/local/bin, $home/bin)



To configure:

1. You need a web server serving from say, /var/www/cran2deb/

Let ROOT be the value returned by running: cran2deb root

2. create /etc/cran2deb
   a. copy ROOT/etc/* into /etc/cran2deb
   b. /etc/cran2deb/archive should be a symlink pointing to /var/www/cran2deb/

    $ ln -s /var/www/cran2deb/ /etc/cran2deb/archive

   c. modify OTHERMIRROR of /etc/cran2deb/pbuilderrc.in to point to your webserver

3. cran2deb needs a persistent cache outside of R's control. therefore, create
    /var/cache/cran2deb, writable by whichever user(s) will run cran2deb.
4. run: cran2deb update
5. Try building a simple package: cran2deb build zoo
   (The result will be in /var/cache/cran2deb/results)


$ cran2deb help
will display a short summary of help for each cran2deb command.
