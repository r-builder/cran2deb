To install:

$ cd ..
$ R CMD INSTALL cran2deb

copy cran2deb/exec/cran2deb into somewhere in your executable path (e.g.,
/usr/local/bin, $home/bin)



To configure:

1. You need a web server serving from say, /var/www/cran2deb/

Let ROOT be the value returned by running: cran2deb root
Let SYS be the system you wish to build for (e.g., debian-amd64)

2. create /etc/cran2deb
   a. copy ROOT/etc/* into /etc/cran2deb/sys/SYS/
   b. /etc/cran2deb/archive should be a symlink pointing to /var/www/cran2deb/

    $ ln -s /var/www/cran2deb/ /etc/cran2deb/archive
    $ mkdir /var/www/cran2deb/SYS

   c. modify OTHERMIRROR of /etc/cran2deb/pbuilderrc.in to point to your webserver

3. cran2deb needs a persistent cache outside of R's control. therefore, create
    /var/cache/cran2deb, writable by whichever user(s) will run cran2deb.
4. run: cran2deb update
5. Try building a simple package: cran2deb build zoo
   (The result will be in /var/cache/cran2deb/results/SYS)


$ cran2deb help
will display a short summary of help for each cran2deb command.


Concerning data/:
This contains scripts necessary to recreate the database should you loose the
database. It's a backup that can be versioned by SVN. There is a script called
pull that, when run from the data directory will recreate all the files from
the database EXCEPT for the licenses. The licenses cannot be recreated because
licenses can be based on one-way hashes.  This process could certainly be
improved.
