To install:

Please install a series of packages that you will need to
run cran2deb successfully:

	sudo apt-get install pbuilder python-gpgme gnupg-agent

You may install cran2deb manually

	$ cd ..
	$ R CMD INSTALL cran2deb

	copy cran2deb/exec/cran2deb into somewhere in your executable path (e.g.,
	/usr/local/bin, $home/bin)

or prepare a Debian package for it

	fakeroot debian/rules binary
	sudo dpkg -i ../r-*cran2deb*.deb


To configure:

1. You need a web server serving from say, /var/www/cran2deb/

Let ROOT be the value returned by running: cran2deb root
Let SYS be the system you wish to build for (e.g., debian-amd64)
Create user "c2d" who shall have write permissions to the archive.

2. create /etc/cran2deb
   a. copy ROOT/etc/* into /etc/cran2deb/
   b. ensure ROOT/etc/sys/SYS is set up
   c. /etc/cran2deb/archive should be a symlink pointing to /var/www/cran2deb/

    $ ln -s /var/www/cran2deb/ /etc/cran2deb/archive
    $ mkdir /var/www/cran2deb/SYS

   d. modify OTHERMIRROR of /etc/cran2deb/sys/SYS/pbuilderrc.in to point to your webserver.
      As long as the packages on debian.cran.r-project.org are not signed with a
      current key, just rebuild also the architecture-dependent packages or find
      a way for pbuilder to ignore the failing gpg signature check.

      Example:
      OTHERMIRROR='deb http://master.dermacloud.uni-luebeck.de/cran2deb/rep testing main'

      The above URL works for the reprepro tool. For mini-dinstall the URL
      may be slightly different. Please check after the first packages have been
      built that do not depend on other packages external to Debian.

   e. run: cran2deb repopulate

3. cran2deb needs a persistent cache outside of R's control. therefore, create
    /var/cache/cran2deb, writable by whichever user(s) will run cran2deb.

4. add to /etc/rc.local:
	# one mini-dinstall daemon for each apt repo
	for sys in debian-i386 debian-amd64
	do
        	mini-dinstall -c /etc/cran2deb/sys/$sys/mini-dinstall.conf
	done
   and execute.

5. manual change - allow cran2deb user to execute pdebuild as root via sudo
	c2d      ALL=(ALL) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pdebuild
   The "SETENV:" is important.

6. run: cran2deb update
   This will also create the pbuilder environment if not already existing.

7. manual changes - create a gpg key for your packages
	gpg --genkey
   and read through 'man gpg-agent' to set it up. Add that key to the
   pbuilder environment so the packages you signed and uploaded are 
   indeed acceptable to the distribution.

	pbuilder --login \
		 --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/base-cran2deb-debian-amd64.tgz \
		 --save-after-login

   Once logged in, in a separate shell perform as cran2deb user a

	gpg --export -a

   which should only be one (your) public key. Copy it with the mouse and
   add it to your pbuilder login shell via

	apt-key add -

   (return) to expect the key from stdin. Paste it, press CTRL-D to end
   the input. Another CTRL-D or 'exit' to leave the shell and have the
   base.tgz updated.

   Also, you should allow the arch-independent R packages to be retrieved
   from the public cran2deb effort. This also requires that key to be
   available. From a local shell copy again that key

	gpg --recv-key BFAEA5C2
	gpg --export -a BFAEA5C2

   and use 'apt-key add -' as before.

8. Try building a simple package: cran2deb build zoo
   (The result will be in /var/cache/cran2deb/results/SYS)

9. Check the specification of your pbuilder settings and run
   'cran2deb update'. Do not run 'cran2deb update full' which
   creates a new pbuilder environment and will require the
   adding of keys again.

10. Educate yourself about the schema of the sqlite3 database,
   which is likely to reside at ~/cache/cran2deb.db 
   and is directly accessible via calling from the 
   UNIX command line 'sqlite3 ~/cache/cran2deb.db' .

   The sqlite3 shell will directly attach to the database.
   See the tables first

	sqlite> .tables
	blacklist_packages  debian_dependency   license_override  
	builds              forced_depends      packages          
	database_versions   license_hashes      sysreq_override   

   and then the schema of the one or other table of interest, e.g.

   sqlite> .schema debian_dependency
	CREATE TABLE debian_dependency (
		id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
		alias TEXT NOT NULL,
		build INTEGER NOT NULL,
		debian_pkg TEXT NOT NULL ,
		UNIQUE (alias,build,debian_pkg) );
   sqlite> .schema forced_depends
	CREATE TABLE forced_depends (
		r_name TEXT NOT NULL,
		depend_alias TEXT NOT NULL,
		PRIMARY KEY (r_name,depend_alias) );
   sqlite> .schema blacklist_packages
	CREATE TABLE blacklist_packages (
		package TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
		nonfree INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
		obsolete INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
		broken_dependency INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
		unsatisfied_dependency INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
		breaks_cran2deb INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
		other INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
		explanation TEXT NOT NULL);
   sqlite> .schema builds
	CREATE TABLE builds (
		id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
		system TEXT NOT NULL ,package TEXT NOT NULL,
		r_version TEXT NOT NULL ,deb_epoch INTEGER NOT NULL,
		deb_revision INTEGER NOT NULL ,db_version INTEGER NOT NULL,
		date_stamp TEXT NOT NULL ,time_stamp TEXT NOT NULL,
		scm_revision TEXT NOT NULL ,success INTEGER NOT NULL,
		log TEXT,
		UNIQUE(package,system,r_version,deb_epoch,deb_revision,db_version));
   sqlite> .schema database_versions
	CREATE TABLE database_versions (
		version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
		version_date INTEGER NOT NULL,
		base_epoch INTEGER NOT NULL );
   sqlite> .schema license_hashes
	CREATE TABLE license_hashes (
		name TEXT NOT NULL,
		sha1 TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL );
   sqlite> .schema license_override
	CREATE TABLE license_override (
		name TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
		accept INT NOT NULL );
   sqlite> .schema packages
	CREATE TABLE packages (
		package TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
		latest_r_version TEXT );
   sqlite> .schema sysreq_override
	CREATE TABLE sysreq_override (
		depend_alias TEXT NOT NULL,
		r_pattern TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL );

   The sqlite3 shell allows to modify all those entries. For a
   restart with defaults entries distributed via svn, run "cran2deb
   repopulate". To update the data stored in svn, change to the data
   directory and run "./pull". Caveat, prior to that, make sure the
   license data was read in by you. This is not performed automatically in
   repopulate, a bit to protect us and stress that everyone is reponsible
   for their own respective interpretation of a license's constraints
   and the effect on a redistribution of source and/or binary.

To think about

1. After several updates of the repository, we have many outdated
   Debian packages in the pbuilder's archive cache. I prefer removing
   them with a skriptlet like

	cd /var/cache/apt/archives \
	&& for i in $(ls | cut -f1 -d_ | uniq -c | egrep -v "^ *1 " | sed -e 's/^\s*[0-9]*\s//')
	   do 
		ls -t ${i}_* | tail -n +2 | xargs -r rm
	   done

2. To investigate which packages are already available in your repository
   and which ones are not, you may add your packages list to your /etc/apt/sources.list
   and perform

	sudo apt-get update
	for i in `grep -i net all_pkgs `
	do
		a=`echo $i|tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'`
		echo "$i:$a"
		apt-cache search r-cran-$a
	done

To debug:

$ cran2deb help
will display a short summary of help for each cran2deb command.

The -d option will prevent the cleaning of the unpacked source code.

To improve:

 * The runtime dependencies for Rgraphviz are outdated (there is no libraphviz4
   any more). To get the package run  this was not changed to "alias_run
   libgraphviz libgraphviz-dev" but this can certainly be optimised
   towards something less resource-hungry.


Concerning data/:
This contains scripts necessary to recreate the database should you lose the
database. It's a backup that can be versioned by SVN. There is a script called
pull that, when run from the data directory will recreate all the files from
the database EXCEPT for the licenses. The licenses cannot be recreated because
licenses can be based on one-way hashes.  This process could certainly be
improved.
